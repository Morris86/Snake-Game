<h1>About the Snake Game Project</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Snake Game Project! This page documents the design decisions, features, and mechanics of the game. Please review the details below to understand what works, what doesn’t, and what makes this project unique.</p>

<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>MVC Architecture:</strong> The project is structured using a Model-View-Controller pattern for separation of concerns, improving readability and maintainability.</li>
    <li><strong>Drawing Copy Optimization:</strong> A separate <code>drawingCopy</code> is used for rendering, reducing lag by isolating drawing operations from live game state updates.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Locking Mechanisms:</strong> Separate locks were implemented for the network controller and rendering logic to handle race conditions efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Extensive error handling ensures that disconnections, invalid data, and navigation errors are managed gracefully without crashing the application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implemented Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Multiplayer Gameplay:</strong> Players can connect to the server, control their snake using WASD keys, and compete with others in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>Dynamic Rendering:</strong> The game dynamically draws snakes, powerups, and walls on the canvas, ensuring smooth updates at 50 frames per second.</li>
    <li><strong>Centered Viewport:</strong> The game viewport centers on the player's snake, providing an intuitive and immersive experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Graphics:</strong> Powerups, walls, and snakes are visually distinct, with unique colors assigned to each player. Pllayer name would also apear besides the snakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Robust Navigation:</strong> Handles unexpected server shutdown, client would disconnect after the server is closed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions for Graders</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start the game server provided in the assignment materials.</li>
    <li>Launch the Blazor client and navigate to the main page.</li>
    <li>Enter a server address, port number, and player name, then click "Connect."</li>
    <li>Use the WASD keys to control your snake. Observe the smooth gameplay, dynamic updates, and accurate collision handling.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the About page only after stopping the game.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Limitations or Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>About Page Accessibility:</strong> Currently, the About page is accessible during gameplay, which could cause navigation-related exceptions. A planned update will disable the page while the game is running.</li>
    <li><strong>Latency Effects:</strong> Players may notice slight delays in movement due to network latency, especially on slower connections.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for reviewing this project. Feel free to test various settings and provide feedback on the gameplay and features!</p>
